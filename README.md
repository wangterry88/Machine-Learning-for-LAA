## Logistic Regression

Overview:
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. It is widely used for binary classification problems.
```
Usage:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Instantiate the model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
---

## SVM Classifier

Overview:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes.
```
Usage:
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Instantiate the model
model = SVC()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
---

## Decision Tree

Overview:
Decision Tree is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It creates a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
```
Usage:
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate the model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
---

## Random Forest

Overview:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
```
Usage:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Instantiate the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
---

## Xgboost

Overview:
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework. It is highly efficient, flexible, and scalable, making it one of the most popular machine learning libraries.
```
Usage:
import xgboost as xgb

# Instantiate the model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
---

## Gradient Boost

Overview:
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
```
Usage:
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Instantiate the model
model = GradientBoostingClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
